####Analysis 

Analyze performance of your algorithm (or implementation) in different situations. 
Change the following parameters and measure computation time:

1. Number of objects (1~50)
2. Complexity of objects (The number of polygons for each object.  Try at least 3 different data sets)
3. Sizes of objects (The relative size of each object w.r.t. the extension of the bounding cube.)

Your algorithm (implementation) should exhibit different characteristics to the variation of these parameters. 
Present data in tables and graphs, and explain the differences in performance.

####Varying Parameters

Objects now have the same size. What would you do differently? Show a simple prototype implementation to compare and contrast the performance of two different algorithms (implementation).
